## Disclaimer

This repository is provided for research and educational purposes only. While the code and data are openly available, they are to be used at your own discretion and risk. I do not personally endorse gambling/sports betting in any form&mdash;I have no financial stake in this project, and I do not intend to use it in any commercial or gambling-related activities. Users should be aware that scraping data from certain websites may breach their Terms of Service, and I take no responsibility for any consequences resulting from misuse of this repository.

Lastly, I will not be maintaining this repository after the completion of my thesis other than updates to documentation as I see fit. All data and model training will be constrained to the data collected up to the end of the 2024 calendar year and I will not be setting up any workflows to automatically make updates. Please feel free to use this work as a reference or starting point for your own research. There are many ways it can be improved&mdash;overall code quality, productionalization, new methods, other data sources, deeper data analysis and feature engineering, etc.
